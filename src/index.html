                    Working on the observability stack, during the internship I set up an infrastructure for observing API uptime. This included containerization of the core application (Uptime) using Docker, creating a CI/CD pipeline for Uptime using Jenkins, and deployment on AWS. The Uptime solution had a major impact, through which the team was able to calculate extremely accurate uptime and health of the services with alerts on communication channels in case of failures, along with other features like the ability to export metrics data.

            For me Tech is a important aspect of my life not becasue its my profession but I just love to build stuff. I hardly have to force myself to code I just feel doing it.<br><br> 
            Experimenting is the key for everything. I just experiment with the stuff during that phase problems occur - those problems provide me the opportunity to solve them and learn something new. I love to solve problems unknown not the ones with predefined answers also I love to explore the depths of the skill which provide me with the ability to solve the problems in a more efficient way.

                    <p class="projectsDescription">Monc is a comprehensive multi-container monitoring solution for servers, focusing on metrics and logs. It consists of three tiers: Export, Store, and Visualize. The Export tier handles exporting metrics and logs using Promtail and Node Exporter. The Store tier is responsible for scraping and storing the exposed data with the help of Prometheus and Loki. Finally, the Visualize tier allows users to see the system's state based on the collected data. Implemented using Docker Compose, Monc enables Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to manage individual components with ease. The complexity of the solution is handled in such a way that a few inputs from the SREs can bring up the entire stack in no time.</p>
